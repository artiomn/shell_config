Shell configuration files
=========================

This is Bash and Zsh tuned configuration.
Zsh config is used [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

- `etc` - global configuration (need to be copied in the `/etc`). Config files were tested on Debian Linux.
- `home` - user configuration files (need to be copied in the every user home directory).
- `install.sh` - basic installer. **If you run it, your configuration will be replaced!**


## Usage

```
./install.sh
```
