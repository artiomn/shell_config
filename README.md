Shell configuration files
=========================

This is Bash and Zsh tuned configuration.
Zsh config is used [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

`etc` - global configuration (need to be copied in the `/etc`). Config files were tested on Debian Linux.
`home` - user configuration files (need to be copied in the every user home directory).
